Run the tests. Did they all pass?

Yes! All the tests I created passed.

Did your partner's implementation match your expectations?

David's implementation exceeded my expectations. He created error messages for various cases without any request from me to. His code passed all my tests as well. Overall, I was impressed with David's implementation of the new circle class!

Did the two of you come up with similar tests? Write up your impressions of the exercise.

We came up with fairly similar tests. We both tested strings, an empty argument, and one too many numbers in the function. It was an interesting exercise. I take that these partner exercises are 'simulations' of working in a team in the future.
